# pure_java_mnist
MNIST Handwriting recognition implemented in pure Java

This project is for beginners to deep learning.
It's slow and inefficient, but wrote it easy to understand.

Matrix.java : Handles matrix calculation. It's basically 2d-double array 
Vector.java : Handles vector calculation. It's basically 1d-double array 
MnistData.java : Loads MNIST dataset files and make it into Matrix
Model.java : Implementation of model with 2 hidden layers and forward/backpropagation algorithm
